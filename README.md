**Movie Purchasing and Selling Web Application Frontend**

This is the frontend application for a web-based platform designed for movies purchasing and selling. Developed using React, the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for buyers and sellers to interact with the movie purchasing process.

**Project Overview**

The frontend application integrates with a backend specifically developed for this project, which can be found at [WADbackend Repository](https://github.com/sahanediriweera/WADbackend). The backend, built with ASP.NET, handles the core business logic, database interactions, and security protocols necessary for the movie purchasing and selling operations.

**Features and Functionality**

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign in and sign up as buyers or sellers to access personalized features.
- **Movie Listings:** Display of movies available for purchase or sale, with detailed information and pricing.
- **Interactive Interface:** Smooth navigation and responsive design ensure an optimal user experience across devices.
- **Integration with Backend APIs:** Utilizes RESTful APIs from the backend for seamless data exchange and functionality.
- **Video Demonstration:** A video showcasing the frontend's features and interface is available on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sahan-ediriweera_this-is-a-front-end-react-project-of-mine-activity-7058381463175499777-PwPp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
